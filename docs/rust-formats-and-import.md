# Rust tensor formats and checkpoint import

The valid GGML storage table is pinned to `b1ff4ca23630ac7c5a275405353ddb5c486332c9` (35 valid IDs; slots 4, 5, 31–33 and 36–38 are removed). Tensor storage support is separate from model architecture support and optimized kernels.

## GGUF v2/v3

Pure Rust decoding supports F32, F16, BF16, Q4_0, Q4_1, Q5_0, Q5_1, Q8_0, Q8_1, Q2_K, Q3_K, Q4_K, Q5_K, Q6_K, Q8_K, IQ2_XXS, IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS, IQ1_S, IQ4_NL, IQ3_S, IQ2_S, IQ4_XS, IQ1_M, TQ1_0, TQ2_0, MXFP4, NVFP4, Q1_0, Q2_0 and scalar I8/I16/I32/I64/F64. Removed type slots fail explicitly. Quantized row lengths and payload sizes are validated before decoding.

Optimized CPU kernels cover the classic, Q8, K and float formats, and on x86-64 also Q2_K, Q3_K, IQ4_NL, IQ4_XS and MXFP4 (docs/cpu-kernels.md). The other added formats retain packed mmap-backed weights and decode individual rows for projections; this is a functional path, not a claim of optimized throughput. GPU formats without a specialized WGSL kernel use an F32 upload. 

## Checkpoint containers

Rust `convert` imports local or Hub-backed safetensors (single file or HF weight-map shards) and restricted PyTorch ZIP state dictionaries (`.bin`, `.pt`, `.pth`, including HF shards). Config and tokenizer files must accompany the weights. It writes GGUF directly; neither Python nor a llama.cpp converter process runs.

Safetensors and uncompressed contiguous PyTorch storage are mmap-backed. GGUF output is streamed with a bounded conversion buffer and atomically published. The PyTorch reader implements an allowlisted pickle interpreter for tensor/storage reconstruction; legacy raw pickle, arbitrary Python constructors, TorchScript and unknown opcodes are rejected.

Dense HF mappings cover supported Llama, Mistral, Qwen2, Qwen3 and K2-Horizon layouts. Model family names alone do not imply variant support. MoE, unsupported scaled/partial RoPE and unknown forward-affecting weights fail rather than silently producing a different model. Llama/Mistral Q/K rows are permuted from HF split-half to GGUF interleaved rotary layout; Qwen rows retain their original order. The complete HF tokenizer JSON is retained and validated against GGUF token IDs.

Checkpoint output types are preserve, F16 and F32. This does not add a GGUF quantizer: loading quantized files and creating new quantized weights are separate operations.

```

HF downloads resolve revisions to immutable commit snapshots in the standard HF cache, honor HF_HOME/HF_HUB_CACHE/HF_TOKEN and support `--local-files-only`. Files are streamed and published without replacing an existing cached file. For GGUF choose a concrete filename instead of downloading every quantization in a repository.
